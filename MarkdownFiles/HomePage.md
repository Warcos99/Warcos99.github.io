# Hello World

This website is subject to change as my sensibilities change, but for now, this is the home of my project logs, my photography portfolio-blog, and my mixtapes and playlists I want to share with the world.

Once the infrastructure is in place, I would like to share my other art on here, like the zines I produce as well as some walkthroughs for some of my more complex hobbies.  

This is meant to be as a repository for myself to keep all my references and notes, as well as a way to share my art with my community and friends.  Not really intended to be a mass traffic site.
