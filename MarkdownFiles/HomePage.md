# Hello World

I pick up a new interest every week, and everytime it happens for the same reason.  I want a thing, and I categorically refuse to buy it, most of the time because I simply cannot afford it, but sometimes just out of sheer stubborn-ness to participate in the systems that have caused me so much stress.

Here, on this website I have created, I intend to keep all of my hard-sought knowledge into one place, for reference for myself and any friends or family that wish to recreate my processes.
