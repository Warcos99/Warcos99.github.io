# Hello World

Hello World, I come here to tell you the wonderful world that is my love.  See things really change whenever one tells the truth, and things really fall apart whenever one really does not.  
So Here I am, telling you of the washer in the dryer, of the cat in the dog, of the day we will all see the truths that are kept from us. No, my friend, I cannot say for sure why, but I can tell you how.
The How comes from the death of the donkey. the how comes from my heart.
Good bie.
