# About Me 

(insert self portrait)

Hello, my name is not Marcos, no my friends, you are reading the dulcet words of Warcos, Marcos' evil twin identity.  For, not even Mario can exist without having to contend with the darkest side of him, Wario.

As Warcos, I am here to present to you the sides of Marcos that Marcos is too afraid for you to see. You better watch out, because if you don't you will find yourself listening to my mixtapes, appreciating my art, and learning how to be an anticapitalist (It's really easy, just quit buying things, and start making them).

If you wish to contact me, email me at jmarcosavin@gmail.com
