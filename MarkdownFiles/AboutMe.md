# About Me 

(insert self portrait)

Hello, my name is Juan Marcos Avina, and this is my first time making a website.  As explained on the main page, this is mostly going to function as a repository for all the things i learn and want to share.  I tend to pick up a new hobby every other month, and this time, that new hobby happens to be learning web-dev. 

I am a 30 year old graduate of the University of Northern Colorado Physics Department.  I have a bachelors degree in mathematical physics, which sounds really impressive, but anyone in the know will tell you is pretty dang useless unless you wish to go into entry level engineering jobs or graduate programs.  That wasn't me. Instead I went into the library world, and have been there ever since.

Since my graduation, I have discovered the joy of play, and the ability to just do the things I want to do without any social stigma.  I have learned to do things that normally I would have been turned away from for being "too late".  I love to play with my art in the fields of watercolor painting and photography.  I have been learning computer sciences, like unix systems, web development.  I have picked up the craft of bookbinding, and I have learned to love cooking.  There is much more, as I said, I pick up a new hobby every other month. 

I think there is this idea that you have to buy into the systems around you to do the things you want.  You want to journal? Buy a new moleskin! You want to have your own website? Buy our licence for squarespace! You want to engage in this cool hobby? Well too bad, you need to buy this product to truly enjoy it.  And I think we need to push back against that mentality.  

There is nothing inherently wrong with people with disposable income spending it on the things that make them happy, but I have been learning for years now, that alot of the things that make people happy are actually free (or at the very least very very cheap).  And the things you see being sold to you are simply that, capitalists selling you solutions that will make them the most profit.

Please use my website to learn some new skills that might make you happy, or at the very least, use it as inspiration that whatever it is that you are interested in is actually very much within your grasp, and you don't have to listen to those capitalists.
